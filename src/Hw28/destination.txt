After a moment of consideration, Xie Lian came to a conclusion, “... Forgive me.” 
He cupped Hua Cheng’s face and voluntarily covered the other’s lips with his own, gently guiding 
the turbulent flow of heat into his own body, helping to ease the pain and suffering of the other. 
Instinctively, Hua Cheng looped his arm around Xie Lian’s waist, making Xie Lian shiver just the slightest. 
In the next second, the two were tumbling on top of the altar. 
It really wasn’t fair. Xie Lian wouldn’t dare touch anywhere on Hua Cheng that’s even slightly dangerous. 
Yet, because of his cloudy state of mind, Hua Cheng’s fingers were roaming across every inch of his body 
shamelessly, making Xie Lian suffer in silent torment. This altar was originally a place where one would 
make offerings to a god, but it now resided a ghost and a god who were entangled in a heated battle of tongues. 
Although preposterous, the scene was beyond breathtaking.
